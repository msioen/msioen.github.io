Over the past month, I built a small challenge game aimed to test out your developer terminology. It's called 'Developer Dictionary Challenge' and it can be found on [https://developer-dictionary.pages.dev](https://developer-dictionary.pages.dev).

The goal of the game is to navigate from one developer term to another, using as little steps as possible. By clicking on an underlined term you get the definition of this word, which will contain other related terms. The challenge ends when you reach the target word.

If you can't get enough of the game after doing the daily challenge, it's always possible to try out the random page where you're able to load infinite challenges.
