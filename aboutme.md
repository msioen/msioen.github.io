Hi! I'm Michiel Sioen. I'm a tech enthusiast, developer, geek and currently the Competence center lead for .NET at [ACA Group](https://www.acagroup.be/).

In previous lives I was CTO at Flow Pilots and an interactive C# developer at the University of Central Lancashire.

I'm the organizer of the [.NET Antwerp Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/Belgian-Mobile-NET-Developers-Group) where I occasionally speak as well.

On here I'll post opinions, issues, challenges and various titbits I run into. Blog posts are often the result of experimentation or wild ideas. Because of this there's a wild range of technologies and topics covered.

Side projects / currently hacking on:

- [kampkok.be](https://www.kampkok.be): platform to help managing the menu and orders for big group events
- [MenuBarCodeReader](https://github.com/msioen/MenuBarCodeReader): small macOS utility to quickly scan QR codes on screen.
- Experiments on Azure AI offering: [Screenshot classification](/2023-02-12-ai-tagger/)

Hope you find something useful here!
