Hi! I'm Michiel Sioen. I'm a tech enthusiast, developer and currently the CTO of [Flow Pilots](https://www.flowpilots.com) where we build awesome digital tools. Before this, I worked for 4 years at the University of Central Lancashire as an interactive C# developer.

On here I'll post opinions, issues, challenges and various titbits I run into. Blog posts are often the result of experimentation or wild ideas. Because of this there's a wild range of technologies and topics covered.

Hope you find something useful here!
